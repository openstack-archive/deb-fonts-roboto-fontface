Description: largely geometric, friendly and open curves font
 Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
 largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
 curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
 Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
 width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
 humanist and serif types.
 .
 This is the normal family, which can be used alongside the Roboto Condensed
 family and the Roboto Slab family.
 .
 This package also provides Css, Scss and LESS files to use webfonts from this
 package.
